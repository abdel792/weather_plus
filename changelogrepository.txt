Added the following lines in the readme 'en' and 'it', and changed to 6.5.
[it]
* Versione: 6.5.
# Versione 6.5 #
* Corretto bug nell'ora locale in "dettagli";
    * La conversione del tempo in 12 ore dava un errore.
[en]
* Version: 6.5.

# Version 6.5 #
* Fixed bug in local time in "details";
    * 12-hour time conversion gave a error.

# Changes #4 in the repository by Rémy Ruiz #
Corrected in readme.md file by Adriano:
* Removed daily saving time function in details;
in:
* Daylight saving time removed in the "Details" function;

# Changes #3 in the repository by Rémy Ruiz #
I removed in dateutil folder, the .pyo, if it recreates it by itself.
Removed also the installTask.py because the author judges it useless.
command to send the file to the stable branch of the repository:
git status
or
git checkout stable
git add .
git commit -a -m "Added the dateutil folder"

Thanks to Abdel.

Weather__Plus 6.4 update
Adriano said:
You may not have noticed, but for some days the local time in the cities is no longer working ...
Changes in add-on:
readme.md (en)
Changed version number (en):
* Version: 6.4.
Removed line (en):
* [https://www.timeanddate.com/](https://www.timeanddate.com/)
Added lines (en):
# Version 6.4 #
* Removed daily saving time function in details;
	* The service used by this function has changed, so it has been removed.
* Improved audio effects reproduction;
	* Now they update regularly if the weather conditions change.

Note by Adriano:
All the remaining doc locations must be updated as described above.
Some strings have been removed from the code(daylight savings time, etc), therefore all nvda.po files must be updated.

I also forgot to advise that in Weather_plus I added the "dateutil" folder to remedy the service I had to remove
For reasons of space the library contains only what is needed to calculate the timezone, otherwise it alone weighed more than 600kb.

# Changes #2 in the repository by Rémy Ruiz #
Changed in buildVars.py file version number:
6.3 to 6.4

I just replaced the files sent by Adriano with his modifications, and I added the folder mentioned above.

Added the information mentioned above in the readme.md file in English, and corrected some typographical errors.

14.05.2019
Modified sconstruct file by Abdel.
The sconstruct file i have does not include the command to copy the readme.md file to the doc / en directory.
I just have to replace the one i have in the root of your local repo. 

This done, execute the following commands: 

git commit -a -m "Fixed the sconstruct file so that the scons command can copy the English readme.md file to the doc / en directory"
git push -u origin master

Now everything works fine.
Thanks to Abdel.

I have updated the changelogrepository file with the good information made yesterday about the .gitignore file.
09-05-2019
I just have to pass this .gitignore  file modified to Abdel to the root of my local repo and confirm the replacement.
That will allow to me be able to author my 2 files "oauth.pyc" and "oauth.pyc" during my next commits.
If the files oauth.pyc and oauth.pyo are present in my local repo, i juste have to do the following commands. 

git add .
git commit -a -m "Corrected the .gitignore file"
git push -u origin master

Now everything works fine.
Thanks to Abdel.

Added sconstruct file.

Renamed this file
changelog.txt
by:
changelogrepository.txt
for a better compression, and not to think that it is the changes in the part of the changes that are in the file readme.md of the addon Weather_Plus.

Added: Weather_Plus.pot file
for the version 6.2 including the modifications in the number of Version in the sources files.

Corrected all nvda.po files in locale with the good number version 6.1 to 6.2.
"Project-Id-Version: Weather_Plus 6.1\n"
by:
"Project-Id-Version: Weather_Plus 6.2\n"

Added new Weather_Plus6.2included last modifications in sources

# Download Weather_Plus6.1 last version by Adriano #
Note please: I have just updated to 6.2 version.
I added a piece of code that strangely with all the passages and was lost and that allowed to recover the cities created with Apixu.
I also added the "Palestine" state which a user sent me via a function which I introduced in the add-on and which signals unregistered states.
