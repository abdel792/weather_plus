I have updated the changelogrepository file with the good information made yesterday about the .gitignore file.
09-05-2019
I just have to pass this .gitignore  file modified to Abdel to the root of my local repo and confirm the replacement.
That will allow to me be able to author my 2 files "oauth.pyc" and "oauth.pyc" during my next commits.
If the files oauth.pyc and oauth.pyo are present in my local repo, i juste have to do the following commands. 

git add .
git commit -a -m "Corrected the .gitignore file"
git push -u origin master

Now everything works fine.
Thanks to Abdel.

Added sconstruct file.

Renamed this file
changelog.txt
by:
changelogrepository.txt
for a better compression, and not to think that it is the changes in the part of the changes that are in the file readme.md of the addon Weather_Plus.

Added: Weather_Plus.pot file
for the version 6.2 including the modifications in the number of Version in the sources files.

Corrected all nvda.po files in locale with the good number version 6.1 to 6.2.

# Download Weather_Plus6.1 last version by Adriano #
Note please: I have just updated to 6.2 version.
I added a piece of code that strangely with all the passages and was lost and that allowed to recover the cities created with Apixu.
I also added the "Palestine" state which a user sent me via a function which I introduced in the add-on and which signals unregistered states.
